# Deep-Learning

* You can able to find this repository as well useful for your deep learning understanding. You can able to find many architecture of the deep learning, and many more .

* Refer the file Spatial Pyramid Pooling to see how to convert the fixed image size for input in the pre-trained model to have any sized image. So it could be useful, because we don't lose much of the information while converting the image size.

* Refer the file Knowledge Distillation, to know more about the knowledge transformation from teacher to the student. Where student Mdoel can be very smaller than the Teacher Model, This is a another way of doing a conversion of larger model into a smaller model. I will give whole credits to the keras offical page example https://keras.io/examples/vision/knowledge_distillation/ . Refer this page for detailed information.
